    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); // 100, 100
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); // 200, 100

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(team); // []... "lux"]
    console.log(players); // []... "lux"] also was changed! 
    // Team is not the array, but just a reference to the original array of players 
    // Whenever you update the original array, the refercne will always go back to see what the values will be 

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    // if you pass in nothing into slice, it will return a copy of the entire array

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team4 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team3 = [...team2];

    // Or use the Array.from( method)
    const team5 = Array.from(players)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;
    console.table(person); // does not work, ust like before it takes a referene 

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // pass in 
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    console.log(cap2); // copied object
    console.log(person); // no added number prop

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = { ...person };
    console.log(cap3);
    // this is a SHALLOW COPY

    // meaning? 
    // This is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. 

    const wes = {
      name: 'wes',
      age: 30,
      social: {
        twitter: '@twitter',
        instagram: 'insta'
      }
    }
    console.log(wes);
    const wes2 = Object.assign({}, wes);
    wes2.name = 'Wesley';
    // console.log(wes2);

    wes2.social.twitter = "@coolman2000";
    console.log(wes2);
    // This is what we mean by shallow copy. Now, if we change the nested object in the copy, it alters the orignal as well!

    const wes3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
    // JSON.stringify(wes) takes the object and makes everything into a string. JSON.parse(...) then takes that string and parses it into the object
    wes3.social.twitter = "@coolman3000";
    console.log(wes);
    console.log(wes3);

    //lodash has a cloneDeep method (you can google), but you should think twice before using it.
    // very rarrely do you ever need to clone an object that deep.
